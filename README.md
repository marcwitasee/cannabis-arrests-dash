# Dynamic Data Vis Dashboard

This repository contains the data and source code that I used to build a dashboard that enables exploration of county arrest data for cannabis offenses in Colorado from 2012 to 2017. The dashboard allows one to explore trends in cannabis arrests at the state level as well as at the county level. It also allows one to identify where there exists racial disparity in the cannabis arrest data for Black residents by comparing the percentage of Black residents represented in the arrest data with the percentage of Black residents represented in the population data.

## Shout outs to inspiring code

A big shout to Andrew McNutt for his awesome and tremendously helpful notes on JavaScript and d3 (functional programming is fun!).

Another shout out to Mike Bostock and his helpful d3 [choropleth example](https://observablehq.com/@d3/choropleth) on Observable, which served as my inspiration for the code I used to create the map on the dashboard. I also used the implementation for a [color legend](https://observablehq.com/@d3/color-legend) that the Observable team provided to create the legend for the dashboard map.
